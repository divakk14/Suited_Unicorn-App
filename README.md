Post Platform


Distinction: Anyone with the app can see the post, make conversation more informal, allow for more connections in the corporation
Title is displayed right next to the name
24 hours message deletion
Top new or hot posts according to how many upvotes . downvotes or likes you get
Comment or dm directly
Weed out posts against community guidelines by LLM
Freemium model:  premium model gives user a summary, one line per post
While creating each post: option to share location, picture, make event(link with google calendar), and make new group
 

I want to create an app that works like twitter, but for a single company or university, where users can post events in the form of a text based post (similar to a tweet). A post can read something like "Hey everyone, I am in front of the main office and would love to spend some time with the interns interested in playing tennis this weekend". This post would be posted on everyone's feed who is using the app, and when another user opens up the app they can see this post and other posts like these in their feed. They will also be able to switch to event summary mode, where they can see a summarised version of the events / information posted in the feed. The summary for the posts contain information like who the post was posted by, time of the post, title of the post, and an event calendar. 

Every user has their bio, list of things they are interested in
Allow location access, show post from around that area, you can increase radius as to what you want

Allow to share location

Regex for email / phone recognition. 
Everyone will have their individual privacy preferences. 
Display name depends on the individual user.
